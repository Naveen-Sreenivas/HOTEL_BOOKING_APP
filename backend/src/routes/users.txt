1. user = new User(req.body);:

User is a Mongoose model that you've defined previously.
new User(req.body) creates a new instance of the User model using the data provided in the req.body object. req.body contains the data sent by the client in the HTTP request, usually in a POST request to create a new user.
This new instance (user) is a document that conforms to the schema defined for the User model.
await user.save();:

user.save() is a method provided by Mongoose to save the document to the MongoDB database.
await is used to wait for the asynchronous save() operation to complete before proceeding to the next line of code. This ensures that the document is fully saved in the database before moving on.



2.  process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY as string

 Type Assertion (as string)
as string: In TypeScript, as keyword is used for type assertions. It tells the TypeScript compiler to treat the value returned by jwt.sign(...) as a string type. This is necessary because TypeScript might not infer the exact type returned by jwt.sign(...) without explicit guidance.

Defining Validation Rules with check:
You use functions like check to define validation rules for the fields in the incoming request. These functions add middleware to your route that check the request data against the defined rules.

Applying Validation Rules:
When a request hits your route, the validation middleware runs first. It checks each field in the request object (req) against the rules defined using check.

Collecting Validation Results with validationResult:
After the validation middleware runs, you use validationResult(req) to collect the results of these checks. This function returns an object that contains any validation errors.

Handling Validation Results:
If there are validation errors, you can handle them by sending an appropriate response to the client. If there are no validation errors, you proceed with the main logic of your route handler.

errors.array()

errors.array() is a method that retrieves an array of error objects from the validation result. Each error object typically contains details about a validation failure for a specific field or condition.
