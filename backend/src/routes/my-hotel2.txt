Encode means to convert data from one form into another, typically for the purpose of transmission, storage, or security. The process of encoding changes the format of data while preserving the information it represents, often to make it more suitable for a specific use case.
******************************************************************************************************************************************
Examples of Encoding:
Text Encoding:

UTF-8: Converts characters into a sequence of bytes.
ASCII: Maps characters to specific numerical codes.
Data Encoding:

Base64: Converts binary data (like images or files) into a text string using a set of 64 characters. This is often used to embed image data within HTML or CSS files.
URL Encoding:

Percent Encoding: Converts special characters in URLs into a format that can be transmitted over the internet. For example, a space character is encoded as %20.
Specific Context of Base64 Encoding:
In the context of the code snippet you provided:

javascript
Copy code
const b64 = Buffer.from(image.buffer).toString("base64");
Base64 Encoding:

Purpose: Converts binary data into a text string composed of a set of 64 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /). This is useful for transmitting binary data over text-based protocols, such as embedding images in HTML or JSON.
Process: Takes the binary data of the image (a sequence of bytes) and transforms it into a text string.
Result: The image.buffer (binary data) is encoded into b64 (a Base64 string).
General Definition:
To encode means to change data into a different format using a specific algorithm, typically to:

Prepare it for transmission.
Store it more efficiently.
Ensure it can be interpreted correctly by different systems.
Practical Example:
Before Encoding:
Binary Data: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
After Encoding (Base64):
Text Data: SGVsbG8=
This transformation allows the binary data to be represented as plain text, which can be easily embedded in documents or transmitted over text-based protocols without corruption or misinterpretation.

Summary:
Encode: To transform data from one format to another, often to make it more suitable for specific purposes like transmission, storage, or processing.
Base64 Encoding: Converts binary data into a text string for easier handling in text-based contexts.
