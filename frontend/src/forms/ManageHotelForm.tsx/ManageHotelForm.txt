 const  formMethods = useForm<HotelFormData>();

******************************************************************************************************************************************
formData is not a built-in function; rather, it is the parameter name for the data object passed to the onSubmit callback function. 

The data object in the context of react-hook-form is a crucial part of handling form submissions. It represents the collected and validated form data when a form is submitted. 

handleSubmit Function
The handleSubmit function is a higher-order function provided by react-hook-form. Its primary purpose is to handle the validation and submission of form data. When you call handleSubmit, you pass in a callback function that will be executed if the form is valid.

Callback Function (formData: HotelFormData) => { console.log(formData); }
This callback function is the actual form submission handler. Here's a breakdown of its role and why it's necessary:

Argument (formData: HotelFormData):

The argument formData is an object that contains all the form data collected from the form fields. The useForm<HotelFormData>() hook ensures that formData adheres to the HotelFormData type, providing type safety.
HotelFormData is a TypeScript type that defines the structure of the form data, including properties like name, city, country, description, type, adultCount, childCount, facilities, pricePerNight, imageUrls, and starRating.
Callback Execution:

The function (formData: HotelFormData) => { console.log(formData); } is executed when the form is submitted and passes validation.
Inside this function, you can define what happens with the form data. In this example, console.log(formData) simply logs the form data to the console.
Purpose of Passing the Callback Function
The primary purpose of passing the callback function to handleSubmit is to define what should happen when the form is successfully submitted. Here's why it's necessary:

Form Validation: handleSubmit first validates the form based on the rules you define using react-hook-form. If the form is invalid, the callback function is not executed, and validation errors are displayed instead.
Data Handling: If the form is valid, handleSubmit gathers all the form data and passes it to the callback function. This is where you can perform actions such as sending the data to a server, updating the application state, or performing any other side effects.
Separation of Concerns: Using handleSubmit with a callback function keeps the form submission logic separate from the form definition, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

formData.append("name",formDataJson.name);
******************************************************************************************************************************************
formData.append: This is a method of the FormData object that adds a new key-value pair to the FormData instance.
"name": This is the key (or field name) that you are adding to the FormData object. It is a string that represents the name of the form field.
formDataJson.name: This is the value associated with the key. It is dynamically set to whatever value formDataJson.name holds. formDataJson is assumed to be an object that contains various form field values, and name is one of its properties.

In a typical scenario, when you see something like facilities[0] within form data or a data structure, it usually denotes an indexed element or property. Hereâ€™s how it typically works in different contexts:


******************************************************************************************************************************************
key value creation
formData.append('facilities[0]', 'WiFi');
******************************************************************************************************************************************
1. Array Access
In programming languages like JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
const facilities = ['WiFi', 'Swimming Pool', 'Gym'];

console.log(facilities[0]); // Outputs: 'WiFi'
console.log(facilities[1]); // Outputs: 'Swimming Pool'
console.log(facilities[2]); // Outputs: 'Gym'
facilities[0]: Refers to the first element in the facilities array, which is 'WiFi'.
facilities[1]: Refers to the second element in the facilities array, which is 'Swimming Pool'.
facilities[2]: Refers to the third element in the facilities array, which is 'Gym'.
2. Form Data and Dynamic Keys
In the context of form data handling or when dynamically constructing keys for objects or form data:

javascript
Copy code
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('facilities[0]', 'WiFi');
formData.append('facilities[1]', 'Swimming Pool');
formData.append('facilities[2]', 'Gym');
Here, formData.append('facilities[0]', 'WiFi') is not accessing an element from an array directly like in the first example. Instead:
'facilities[0]' is used as a key (not an index) in the FormData object.
'WiFi' is the value associated with this key.
Key Differences
Array Access: facilities[0] in array context accesses the actual element in that position in the array.
FormData Key: 'facilities[0]' in FormData context is a string used as a key to organize and send data, not directly accessing array elements.

Array.from(formDataJson.imageFiles).forEach((imageFile)=>{
    formData.append(`imageFiles`,imageFile);
})

 Iterating Over FileList
FileList: When you select files using an <input type="file"> element that allows multiple selections (multiple attribute), the selected files are stored in a FileList object. However, FileList is not an array but a collection similar to an array.

Array.from(): This method converts an array-like object (such as FileList) into a real array. This transformation enables you to use array methods like forEach, map, filter, etc., which are not directly available on a FileList object.

Resulting output:
// [
//   ["imageFiles", File { name: "image1.jpg", type: "image/jpeg" }],
//   ["imageFiles", File { name: "image2.png", type: "image/png" }]
// ]
