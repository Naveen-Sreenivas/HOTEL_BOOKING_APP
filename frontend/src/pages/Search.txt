useQuery Hook:

useQuery is a hook provided by react-query for fetching data asynchronously. It manages the fetching, caching, and updating of the data.
Query Key:

["searchHotels", searchParams] is the query key. It uniquely identifies this query within the react-query cache.
The query key is an array where the first element ("searchHotels") is a static key indicating the type of data being fetched.
The second element (searchParams) is a variable representing the parameters used for searching hotels. By including searchParams in the query key, react-query can differentiate between different sets of search parameters and manage the cache accordingly.
Query Function:

() => apiClient.searchHotels(searchParams) is the query function. This is an asynchronous function that fetches the data. In this case, it calls apiClient.searchHotels with the searchParams.
apiClient.searchHotels is presumably a function that sends an HTTP request to an API endpoint to retrieve a list of hotels based on the search parameters.
Destructuring the Result:

The useQuery hook returns an object with several properties, including data, error, isLoading, and more.
const { data: hotelData } uses destructuring to extract the data property from the result of useQuery and renames it to hotelData.
hotelData will hold the data fetched by the query, which, in this context, is expected to be the hotel search results.
