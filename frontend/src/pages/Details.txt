white-space: pre-line Means
Key Features
Collapses Extra Spaces:
Definition: Consecutive whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) are collapsed into a single space.
Example: If your input text has multiple spaces or tab characters, they will be rendered as just one space in the output.
Preserves Line Breaks:
Definition: Line breaks created by pressing the Enter key (or newline characters) are preserved.
Example: If you have a line of text followed by a newline, that text will start on a new line in the output.
